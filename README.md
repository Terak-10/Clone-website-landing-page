# Clone of Nexter Landing Page ðŸš€ 


# in progress


This is a challenge for me. When after the first 4 "projects" in which I found out how felx-box, grid-system, responsiveness / media querie, responsive fonts, variables, mixins and various other things work, now it is important for me to start using everything so that it was the best and it is reflected in my projects!



1. Clone project
2. npm install
3. npm run start 

&ENJOY
